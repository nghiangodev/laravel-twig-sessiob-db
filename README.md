# Demo How to use Session Database

<p>
A session database is a type of database used to store information about user sessions in web applications. When a user logs into a web application, the application creates a session for that user, which is essentially a way of keeping track of the user's activity on the site.
The session database stores information such as the user's session ID, which is a unique identifier assigned to each session, as well as any data associated with that session, such as the user's login status, preferences, and browsing history.
Session databases are typically used in conjunction with web servers and programming languages that support session management, such as PH or Java.
They are an important component of many web applications, as they enable developers to create personalized experiences for users by storing and retrieving data
about their interactions with the site.
